  <div class="right"><p>I am originally from Belarus and I moved here about 4 years ago. I still miss my home country, so I go back there several times a year. When I moved to the US, I did not speak English at all, so City College of San Francisco was my savior, and I have spent here an enormous amount of time. First, I was taking non-credit classes but soon enough I have realized they are not challenging enough. Then, I started taking credit ESL classes at CCSF, and very soon I was comfortable enough to take other classes of my interest. <br><br>

Since I have a bio-engineering background, I wanted to apply my engineering skills but in the computer science field. One of my first classes were Linux and Python classes; I enjoyed those courses so much so that next semester I had SQL, Software Engineering, Advanced Python and Linux Administration courses. A learned a lot and all the classes were challenging to me, but I completed all the requirements to gain several Certificates of Achievement.<br>
My next step is getting more knowledge in Web Development, so I can be more comfortable in Front End Programming. My ultimate goal is to gain enough knowledge, so I could get an entry-level job in any of the fields I have the expertise in; nowadays I am more inclined towards front end developer position.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<ul>

<li> I am a big dog lover, and since I cannot have a pet at our apartment, I am going to CPCA every week to help out with dogs.</li>
<li> I am an avid traveler, and I like visiting different places. Even though this year has not been good for traveling, I hope that next year I will catch up and spend more time abroad.</li>
<li> I like to work out at my favorite gym Platnet Fitness, but again, this year has changed that. I am hoping it will soon be opened again, so I can start excercising at the club.</li>
