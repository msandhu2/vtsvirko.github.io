  <div class="item3"><p>I am originally from Belarus and I moved here about 4 years ago. I still miss my home country, so I go back there several times a year. When I moved to the US, I did not speak English at all, so City College of San Francisco was my savior, and I have spent here an enormous amount of time. First, I was taking non-credit classes but soon enough I have realized they are not challenging enough. Then, I started taking credit ESL classes at CCSF, and very soon I was comfortable enough to take other classes of my interest. <br><br>

Since I have a bio-engineering background, I wanted to apply my engineering skills but in the computer science field. One of my first classes were Linux and Python classes; I enjoyed those courses so much so that next semester I had SQL, Software Engineering, Advanced Python and Linux Administration courses. A learned a lot and all the classes were challenging to me, but I completed all the requirements to gain several Certificates of Achievement.

<div class="item4">
<p>My next step is getting more knowledge in Web Development, so I can be more comfortable in Front End Programming. My ultimate goal is to gain enough knowledge, so I could get an entry-level job in any of the fields I have the expertise in; nowadays I am more inclined towards front end developer position. </p>
