        <h2>Ionic, React Native, and Flutter as alternatives for PhoneGap</h2>
        <p>
            PhoneGap is a framework for hybrid app development that has been
around for over a decade. It has been quite widely adopted in the
industry and lets developers build applications using JavaScript, CSS,
and HTML. Such top-rated products like the Wikipedia app, Paylution
app, TripCase app, and the DHS program have been built using this
framework. Unfortunately, on August 11, 2020, Adobe announced that
they would be discontinuing development on PhoneGap and
PhoneGap build after October 1, 2020.</p>
<p>
There are some excellent alternatives for developers that include
React Native, Flutter, Ionic Capacitor, Framework7, NativeScript,
Monaca, and others</p>
<h3>React Native Benefits.</h3>
<p>There are a host of benefits that put React Native ahead of
PhoneGap. Perhaps most importantly, React Native is faster.
However, speed is not the only advantage it has. Developed by
Facebook, React Native is an open-source framework that lets
developers build native applications using JavaScript.</p>
<ul>Reuse Code and Pre-Developed Components. From a
development point of view, not having to rewrite code is a huge
time saver. React Native lets developers reuse code (or parts of
the code) between iOS and Android. In addition, React Native
Web provides developers an opportunity also to share a
codebase between web applications and mobile apps.
<li>Hot Reloading. This is a huge timesaver for developers. Hot
reloading lets them keep the app active, while new version
changes are introduced and UI changes made. Developers are
able to see the changes in real-time instead of having to rebuild
the app.</li>
<li>Publish Updates Faster. With React Native apps can be
updated in the background in real-time through the use of over
the air (OTA) updates. With React Native, users do not need to
go to the App Store or the Play Store – instead, the updates are
sent automatically and are ready for the user when they open the
app.</li>

<li>Large User Community. Regardless of a developer’s skills and
experience, it is almost inevitable that they will, at some point,
run into an unforeseen roadblock. This is where a strong user
community can be quite helpful. React Native is not only popular
on Facebook (which is not a surprise considering which
company created it) but has a very active GitHub React Native
Community also.</li>
<li>Cost Savings. Perhaps most importantly, by creating a single
application that can be run on multiple platforms, developers can
save significant effort. This has a direct impact on the time spent
and helps businesses save significant amounts of money.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flutter Benefits</h3>
<p>As a newer development kit, Flutter, released in 2017 and created by
Google, takes into account many technology changes that have
occurred since PhoneGap was initially released. Flutter’s philosophy
embraces the differences on the platforms. So while the functionality
remains the same, the typography and icons might be different. As
one of the newer development technologies on the market, Flutter has
experienced meteoric popularity. Some key benefits to note for Flutter
are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick Learning Curve – a significant benefit to developers new
to the platform is how quick and easy it is to get started with
Flutter. Installation of the development environment takes 30
minutes or less, and developers can start work immediately after
that.</li>
<li>Live Reload Capabilities – typically, developers need to write
their code, compile it, and then load it on a device to see it in the
real world. However, in a similar vein to React Native, Flutter
also lets developers utilize a hot reloading capability.</li>
<li> Performance Improvements – as a newer framework, Flutter is
continually improving. Flutter 1.17 saw an improvement in
rendering performance on iOS devices of 50%. In addition, this
release also saw a decrease in memory consumption of close to
70% for some tasks. Flutter application performance is similar to,
if not better than, native apps. The reason for this is that the

Flutter app is written directly to the machine code. This is
different from many other apps that require intermediate code
and interpretation.</li>
<li>Improved Time to Market – Flutter gives developers and
businesses the tools it needs to save time and effort when
creating code. This directly translates to a reduced time to
market, which helps ensure that companies are better able to
account for changing market conditions. The primary reason for
this increase in speed is its cross-platform capabilities.</li></ul>
<h3>Ionic Benefits.</h3> 
<p>Ionic is a popular hybrid cross-platform technology that can be leveraged
on various platforms with a unified codebase. With Ionic, developers can
create cross-platform hybrid applications for native and web, iOS, and
Android platforms. Ionic makes the finest use of web technologies like
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and needs a Cordova plugin to wrap the
applications in native containers. It has strong community support offering
fast solutions and continual updates. It shows great performance and is
liked by web and mobile app developers due to its easy-going learning
curve.</p>
<ul><li>Developer-friendly. Ionic allows web developers to build
applications. Although we have experience building custom
apps, it’s easier and less time consuming to leverage Ionic’s
framework than start each project from scratch.</li>
<li>with an entire suite of tools, with native
compatibility. Along with the framework, Ionic’s team is
constantly testing, perfecting, and releasing new, Ionic-built APIs
that work across platforms. With Ionic, we get a library of
components and plugins, including front-end building blocks, UI
components, common app icons, etc. The plugins also allow us
to connect to a users’ native phone APIs like Bluetooth, GPS,
and their camera without having to build custom integrations.</li>
<li>Free and Open source. To develop hybrid app, Ionic is the best and 100 % free,
open source framework licensed under MIT. It works differently in the context of
unexpected breakdown that other open-source frameworks come across. With open

source frameworks, you can get caught with a shaky architecture that may break. With
Ionic, things are extraordinary as it is steady, quick and dependable. Ionic App
Development will prove to be very savvy with quick development of an application.</li>
<li>Easy testing: With the Ionic system, Mobile App testing gets simpler on mobile
browser or on safari in iOS devices. An Ionic developer can test the application on the
work area program and direct test system testing for Android and iOS applications
with the help of Cordova commands. The attempt to create a mobile app based on
Ionic framework is infrequently a failure with such a significant number of testing
services.</li>
<li>Powerful CLI(Command-Line-Interface): The great command line interface
is a built-in development server used in Ionic framework. It is text-based interface
where a user uses the command prompt to interact with the application through the
help of various commands.</li></ul>
